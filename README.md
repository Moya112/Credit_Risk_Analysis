# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17: Machine Learning

# Project Overview of the Analysis
A peer-to-peer lending services company will use the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, use a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we will compare the two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. The performance of these models and a written recommendation on whether or not to foretell credit risk will be asses after the completion of the analysis.
